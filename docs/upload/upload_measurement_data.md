# Upload measurement data

After creating measurements in the data manager, you can upload measured data to our platform.
This section gives an overview of how to upload data to measurements from QBiC's data manager.

## Prerequisites

The following is required in order to successfully execute the measurement data upload.

- Access to the project of interest
- A SFTP client software (e.g. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org)
  or [WinSCP](https://winscp.net))
- A LDAP account of the University Of T√ºbingen
- A connection to the University Of T√ºbingen network (
  e.g. [using the University VPN](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/facilities/zentrum-fuer-datenverarbeitung/services/network-services/network-access/remote-access-vpn/))

## Connect to the SFTP server

Uploading your files to us was never this easy! SFTP is a broadly used file transfer protocol. The
wide-spread use ensures that there exists many client software products that
support uploading files to us.
In this section we will go through the process of connecting to our server
using [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org) as an example.

![An image showing the button leading to the site manager](./images/open-site-manager.png)
**Open the Site Manager:** You need to add QBiC's upload server as a site to _FileZilla_.

![An image showing the input fields for a new site. upload.qbic.uni-tuebingen.de is entered in the Host field and SFTP is selected as protocol.](./images/add-qbic-site.png)
**Add the upload server:** In the _Site Manager_ you can add sites to which you want to connect. For
measurement data registration, select `SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol` and
enter `upload.qbic.uni-tuebingen.de` into the `Host` field.
You can log in with your _University of T√ºbingen_ credentials. Enter your university user account
into the `User` field.

![An image showing the users home folder. You can see three directories named registration, error and upload.](./images/initial-user-directory.png)
**Connect to the server:** Make sure you are in the network of the _University of T√ºbingen_. You can connect to the server by pressing `Connect` in
the _Site Manager_. After connecting to the server, _FileZilla_ shows you the contents of your home directory.

!!! warning
    When you first log in, the server will create some folders. Do not delete these folders!

## Prepare your data for upload

You need to prepare your data for us to know to which measurement to attach it. Uploading data to a
measurement is called data registration in the following section.
Folders with a given structure that are moved into the `registration` folder, are automatically
registered in our system.
For every registration task, the data needs to reside in a folder with the following structure:

```text
|- my-registration-batch  // folder name is irrelevant
 |- file1_1.fastq.gz
 |- file1_2.fastq.gz
 |- file2_1.fastq.gz
 |- file2_2.fastq.gz
 |- metadata.txt  // mandatory!
```

!!! info
    You can upload folders in the same way. Everything at the top level of your created folder is
    considered. For uploading folders, specify the name of the folder instead of a file name. 
    Uploading only specific files from a sub directory is not supported at the moment.


The folder `my-registration-batch` represents an atomic registration unit and must contain the
`metadata.txt` with information about the measurements identifier and the files belonging to this
measurement
dataset.
One registration task can register data for multiple measurements. The `metadata.txt` file for the
previous example would look like this:

!!! note
    Please ensure that measurement identifier and filename are separated by a TAB `\t` character and not
    by spaces.

```text
NGSQTEST001AE-1234512312  file1_1.fastq.gz
NGSQTEST001AE-1234512312  file1_2.fastq.gz
NGSQTEST002BC-3321314441  file2_1.fastq.gz
NGSQTEST002BC-3321314441  file2_2.fastq.gz
```

## Upload your data

Once you have prepared your folder, upload it to your user directory on our server. Please do not
upload directly to the registration folder but stage it instead in your user directory.
Once your folder is prepared and uploaded to `upload.qbic.uni-tuebingen.de`, move it to
the `registration` folder.

Our system will then transfer the folder and proceed with data registration.

!!! success
    Congratulations you have uploaded your data!

## Handle failed uploads

Uploading data to a measurement can fail in certain cases. When an upload fails, a folder is created
in  `/home/<your-user>/error`.
![An image showing the error folder. It contains a directory with a long name.](./images/error-directory.png)
In this new folder, you can find an `error.txt` file describing the error, and the data you tried to upload.
You can then try to fix the error and upload again.
