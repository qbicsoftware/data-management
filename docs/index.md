# Life Science Data Management

Behind every great research project should be great research data management!
Start your voyage towards a __FAIR__ and __Open Data__ future and include
the [data manager](https://rdm.qbic.uni-tuebingen.de/login) platform early on in your research!

## What's new in 4th September 2024

- Measurements can now be registered and updated
  directly [with XLSX spreadsheets](measurement/measurement_introduction.md). TSV is still
  supported.
- The data manager is now connected to the [TIB terminology service](https://terminology.tib.eu).  
  The queried ontologies are restricted to life science specific ones. You miss one? Please let us
  know and submit
  a [feature request](https://github.com/qbicsoftware/data-manager-app/issues/new/choose). Currently
  included ontologies are:
    - Bio-assay Ontology (__BAO__)
    - Brenda Tissue Ontology (__BTO__)
    - Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (__CHEBI__)
      Bioinformatics operations, data types, formats, identifiers and topics (__EDAM__)
    - Experimental Factor Ontology (__EFO__)
    - Environmental Factor Ontology (__ENVO__)
    - Gene Ontology (__GO__)
    - Molecular Interaction (__MI__)
    - PSI Mass Spectrometry Ontology (__MS__)
    - National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (__NCIT__)
    - Plant Ontology (__PO__)
- For
  species, [terms can be selected](ontology_search/ontology_search_introduction.md)
  from [NCBI's tree of life](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005912).
